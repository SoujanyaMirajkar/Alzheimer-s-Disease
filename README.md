# Alzheimer's Disease 
## INTRODUCTION
Data Analysis on Alzheimer's Disease Prediction. 
The dataset offers a multitude of analytical avenues for understanding Alzheimer’s
disease. By conducting prevalence analysis, we can unveil the disease’s overall
occurrence across various years and locations. Demographic trends exploration
allows for insights into how Alzheimer’s cases are distributed among different age
groups, genders, and ethnicities, shedding light on prevalence variations across
demographic strata. Geospatial mapping enhances our understanding by visu-
ally representing the geographic distribution of Alzheimer’s cases, enabling the
identification of regions with differing prevalence rates. Temporal trend analysis
reveals how the disease’s prevalence has evolved over time, uncovering significant
temporal patterns. Additionally, confidence interval analysis ensures robustness
in prevalence estimations. Furthermore, delving into age-specific, gender-specific,
and ethnicity-specific analyses provides deeper insights into prevalence variations
within specific demographic categories.

## KNOWING THE DATASET
The dataset is provided in CSV format and includes a variety of columns capturing essential information related to Alzheimer’s surveys and statistics. It provides
a comprehensive view of Alzheimer’s Disease and Healthy Aging, allowing for
analyses related to prevalence, demographics, confidence intervals, and geographic
variations. Researchers could explore trends, correlations, and patterns to gain insights into the impact of Alzheimer’s on different populations.It consists of 250937
instances and 16 columns.The memory usage is 30.6+ MB with data types float64,
int64, object.
